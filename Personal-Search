# Host your own search-engine

CAUTION! This isn't about making your own search engine from scratch but hosting one from pre-existing open sourced code of [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng)

## What is SearXNG?
SearXNG is a free internet metasearch engine which aggregates results from various search services and databases. Users are neither tracked nor profiled.

## Requirements
- Linux Environment
- Docker-Compose
- Internet connection

## Getting started 
copy the script below into a bash file or directly into your terminal

### Debian/Ubuntu based installations

```bash
sudo apt install docker-compose 
cd $HOME
cd /usr/local/searxng-docker
```
If you're on a cloud server, do open the `.env`file and replace the `HOST-NAME  `with your machine's domain name.

Once you're done. Here's the last line to finish.
```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d 
```
this will start your search engine, if you're doing this on your own machine, go to ```localhost``` on your browser and check it out.

to put it down once you're done playing, type this.
```bash
sudo docker-compose down
```
